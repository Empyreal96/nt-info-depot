			   COMBINE.COM v2.00

COMBINE.COM will concatenate all of the files in the interrupt list
distribution archives into a single master file, which is required by
some viewers and hypertext conversion programs.

To use COMBINE, just change to the directory into which you extracted
the distribution archives, and type

	COMBINE {dir}

where {dir} is the name of the directory in which you want the combined
list to be stored (typically, you will type "COMBINE ." to store the
result in the same directory as the individual sections).  If there is
not enough free disk space to hold both the individual sections and the
combined list, you will be told and given the option of running COMBINE
again with an option to tell it that it should delete each section as
it is added to the combined file:

	COMBINE -d {dir}

COMBINE will skip any missing sections of the interrupt list; if at
least one section other than INTERRUP.A is present, it will stop as
soon as the last section has been processed (otherwise, it will
continue trying all names through INTERRUP.Z).  On completion, it sets
the combined file's timestamp to be the same as that of the last of
the individual sections.

System Requirements:
	DOS 2.0+ or a DOS compatibility box
	64K available RAM
	a copy of the interrupt list :-)
	sufficient free disk space (~360K with the -d option)
